#dictionary does not have index value as tuple and list
# instead of iindex we have user define keys
# Note Keys value must be unqie
# dictionary have to attrubutes Key "" and value
# Example 
my_dict={
    "name":"chinmay",
    39:"This is the float",
    "age":20,
    "location":"mumbai"
        
             }
# using the dictionary Keys
print(my_dict[39])

# 1 , 1.0, True are the same (please don't use it as the the keys).
# example
my_abc={
    1:"This is integer",
    1.0:"This is float",
    True:"This is boolean"
        }
print(my_abc[1])
